My implementation of [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/) in Swift 4. I'm spending a lot of time on this, but it's fun and cool to get the answer and that gold star, and then iterate and optimize my code and try to use new [Swift 4](https://swift.org/blog/swift-4-0-released/) features, functions, and more, as well as to use [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) more!

To see each day's implementation, check out the rest of the README below or click on `AdventOfCode.playground` and then visit the `Pages` folder.
